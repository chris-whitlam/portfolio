It's a 2D puzzle game where you have to tap on shapes to spin them so the neighbouring colours match. There are set levels that are handmade but also daily challenges that are generated by an algorithm. It also features leaderboards that keep track of who completed the daily challenge in the shortest time and fewest moves.

It uses Google Play's leaderboard and sign-in to store user's scores and authenticate them. It also uses Google Anayltics to track user's activity.
