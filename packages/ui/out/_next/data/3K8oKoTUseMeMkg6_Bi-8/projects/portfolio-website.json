As the pages are static it was a perfect fit. The components extend MaterialUI's components to fit my custom theme and design - though I certainly don't claim to be a designer! The images and content are all fetched from GraphCMS so I can quickly and easily add new projects and blog posts. I plan on using a webhook to trigger a build in Netlify to redeploy the site when I make a change to the content.
