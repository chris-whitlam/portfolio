# Portfolio Website (API)
This is the back-end api package of my portfolio website. It's written in Typescript and uses Netlify's cli tool to run the api. This is because the the website is hosted on Netlify and it requires the files in a specific directory and format to run when deployed.

## Prerequisites
  - node
  - yarn

## Setup
1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
2. Run the site locally with `yarn dev`.

## Useful Commands
All commands must be prefixed with `yarn` e.g `yarn install`
